# phaser-starter

This is a basic project written in ES5 for the Phaser framework. 
It has the basic code to run your games.

# How to setup
In order to use this template you must have **npm**, **gulp** and **yarn** installed globally into your local machine.
Then you just need to run this command:
```
yarn install
```

# Build your project
When developing your game you just have to run
```
gulp
```
in order to make **gulp** "watch" the changes you make to your JavaScript files and automatically compile it, but if you want to make a manual build you have to run
```
gulp build
```


# TO-DO
* Nothing for now :)

Et voil√†, you're ready to code your game :)
